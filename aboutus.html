            <p>Hello! My name is Sabrina SuzÃ¡n, and I am the founder and CEO of Rosie JewelsCoÂ®. I am a Mexican entrepreneur with a passion for creating unique jewelry and spirituality in my own journey. I've always found jewelry as a very powerful companion. The idea of wearing a small detail that carries a bigger significance (whether it has a story, it is a gift from someone special, and/or it has personal meaning) struck me deeply.</p>
            <p>Rosie JewelsCoÂ® was founded in 2021, based in Mexico City, Mexico. Before launching, I experienced a long journey on learning how to make jewelry for myself and those close to me. After a lot of practice, creation of concept, brand, and designs (as well as support from friends and family), I took the leap! Welcome, and thank you for being here.</p>

            <h1 class="title-who">Why is RosieÂ® Jewels Co.?</h1>
            <p>At RosieÂ® Jewels Co., my objective is to help you express and connect more with your authenticity and spirituality, through customized designs that you can resonate with. Spirituality is a very personal practice and journey. Beautiful things arise when we connect with ourselves, at the same time we connect with the world around us. Therefore, I hope you can find some new jewelry additions to your life that can help you feel closer to yourself and your personal path to spirituality. Wear your items feeling proud of the parts of yourself and your journey/practice/spirituality that make you unique!</p>
