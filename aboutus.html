            <p>Hello! My name is Sabrina Suzan, and I am the founder and CEO of RosieÂ® Jewels Co. I am a Mexican entrepreneur with a passion for creating unique jewerly and spirituality in my own journey. I've always found jewerly as a very powerful companion. The idea of wearing a small detail that carries a bigger significance (whether it has a story, it is a gift from someone special, and/or it has personal meaning) struck me deeply.</p>
            <p>RosieÂ® Jewels Co. was founded in 2021, based in Mexico City, Mexico. Before launching, I experienced a year-long journey on learning how to make jewerly for myself and those close to me. After a lot of practice, creation of concept, brand, and designs (as well as support from friends and family), I took the leap! Welcome, and thank you for being here.</p>

            <h1 class="title-who">Why is RosieÂ® Jewels Co.?</h1>
            <p>At RosieÂ® Jewels Co., my objective is to help you express and connect more with your authenticity and spirituality, through customized designs that you can resonate with. Spirituality is a very personal practice and part of ourselves, as well as our journey. Beautiful things arise from ourselves when we connect with ourselves, at the same time we connect with the world around us. Therefore, I hope you can find some new jewerly additions to your life that can help you feel closer to yourself and your personal path to spirituality. Wear your items feeling proud of the parts of yourself and your journey/practice/spirituality that make you unique!</p>
